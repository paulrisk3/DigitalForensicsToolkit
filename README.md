# Digital Forensics Toolkit

A compliation of tools that I have used or might use for digital forensics purposes, sorted by function.

## Network tools

### [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)

Wireshark is one of the first names you'll hear in network forensics. This tool is used for network packet capture and analysis. I first used this tool in my junior year at BYU. The GUI is simple to use and provides a great introduction to internet traffic to the uninitiated. One of its main features, the packet filter, took me a month or two of occasional use to begin to understand, but that was more due to my lack of experience with network terminology than anything else.

This tool is heavily used across the network and forensics industry. To know what data is moving across your network, you can't go wrong by checking out Wireshark.
